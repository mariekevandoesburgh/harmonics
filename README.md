Here we provide the complete data-set reported in van Doesburgh & van der Klis 2020 (in prep.).
We include QPO fit parameters per source per group. 
We give the source name, ObsID, and centroid frequencies, FWHM, integral power (IP) and significance for QPO_(1/2), QPO_1, QPO_2, and QPO_3. Additionally, in the last three columns we give Type B/C classifications (if no such classification was found we write '-'), and the time selection (first and last start times). 
In each header we indicate column-names (where QPO_0 = QPO_(1/2)) that for Groups 1, 2, 3, 4 are identical. In Group 3a, the fit parameters of the two 'jumping' QPOs are reported in two 'QPO_0'-columns.
